			  	<h1>Technology for Cyberbullying Detection</h1>

				<div class="twit">
					<p>With the emergence of these Social Networking Sites, there has
						been an increase in cyberbullying circumstances, particularly among
						young adults. Two individuals from Malaysia, Lieu Chong Hon and Kasturi Dewi Marathon,
						understand why it is important to know why and how people use these tools,
						as they can often be used for unethical reasons by irresponsible users
						to cyberbully and post something in which it personally harms an
						individual. They have written a proposal, “Cyberbullying Detection System
						on Twitter,” which is a web application with the key function to effectively
						discover the cyberbullying related tweet from Twitter and providing
						reasonable solution thereafter.</p>
					<p>With this system them users can identify the cyberbullying related
						tweets based on keywords and popular it in a news feed form. By doing this,
						it allows users to determine the identities of cyberbullies and the victims
						from cyberbullying tweets and will be able to help relay information to
						authorities based on the case’s severity.</p>

					<div class="conclu">
					<p>While technology continues to grow in ways that support worldwide
						communication, it is important to note the negative effects it can have.
						It is obvious that cyberbullying will increase as the number of users and
						the accessibility to the Internet rises, but with the rapid advancements
						in technology today we can help prevent some of the severe outcomes of
						cyberbullying and maintain these diverse communities a positive
						and safe place for self-expression.</p>
