              After having visited Art Metropole to help direct the final assignments as well as
              being an enjoyable trip in itself, it is very clear about the culture and who the Art Metropole advocates for
              and supports—independent creators in Toronto and around the globe. One thing to note was the overwhelming amount
              of zines and self-motivated prints and creations
              that have been dropped off and accumulated over what one could assume would be a few years. While I decided
              to grab the traditional definition of a "book," I think it is interesting to compare the book in the traditional
              sense and what it is slowly transforming into.

                THE AIR WE SWIM IN; WE'RE NO LONGER TAKING THEM IN, BUT JUST SURROUNDING OURSELVES WITH THEM, AS IF WITH TEXUAL
                WALLPAPER."</p><br><p style="text-align:center; color: #0000ff; font-size: 16px; width: 50%; margin: 0 auto;">- Pico Iyer, When Word Becomes Art</p>

              <br><br><p style ="font-size: 13px;">Pico Iyer's, When Word Becomes Art, sparked a thought on the ephermermality of the world we are currently existing in today.
              Although books, zines, and publications, often take physical forms and have the potential to physically exist forever once printed,
              it seems as though their use and interest in them can only last so long. Publications that are printed cannot be changed any further once the
              ink has been set, they may eventually become outdated, but become a piece of sentimentality.</p>

                <br><p style ="font-size: 13px;">Another interesting point to be made is how books are transitioning into something that is becoming more valuable.
                As things become more scarce, they rise in value as the frequency of their production decreases. Today we have magazines that can cost of up $30, often
                focused on lifestyle and what many consider to be "good design"—clean, simple, fresh—minimal. Because of this rise in price, books are becoming
                less accessible. Comparatively speaking, an online publication is easily accessible and affordable in comparison to printing out copies. This was the aim of the
                first page of this website. I created an interactive page that I hope expresses the idea that getting books are becoming or going to become more difficult to obtain.
                This idea is translated as the user is never able to "click" on the book, as it constantly moves further away—similar to how we are <em>currently</em> moving further away from printed
                publications. I say currently with emphasis because I stil firmly believe printing will come back around, and will stick around.

                <br><p style ="font-size: 13px;">It is has also become much  easier to share stories and information, as well as keep them updated when publishing online. But because we are living so rapidly, things go out of
                date faster, we are living ephemerally. This is extremely evident in the way younger people communicate, especially with Snapchat which is a platform
                that is solely based on ephemeral messaging. "Stories" are a feature that have been implemented on multiple platforms where one can upload a moment of their day
                and will only be available to the viewer for up to 24 hours before it expires forever—unless the poster decides to save it.

                <br><br><p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: 'helvetica'; color: #ff0000; line-height: 120px; font-size: 100px; margin: 0 auto;">
                  SO THEN WHY THE <u>HELL</u> DO WE STILL DO IT?</p>

                <br><br><p style ="font-size: 13px; margin-bottom: 300px;">We do it because every now and then we need a break. We need to slow down, and as humans, we desire balance. Books will still
                  be cherished because of their tangibility giving depth and in some instances more intimacy between the creator and consumer. This is especially evident in the zines
                  that were sprawled throughout Art Metropole. The idea of a zine is like peering through a little window of someone's mind, what they were thinking that day, in that moment,
                  during that time and place. However right now, the time and place for books have become much shorter, that doesn't mean they will stop being produced, they'll just become
                  more quickly produced. And once we get tired of that, we'll return to our old ways in which history will inevitably call upon itself and take on a new form.
